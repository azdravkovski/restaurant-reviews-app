#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Stages 

**Stage One** 
- Took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. 
- Added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

**Stage Two**
- Changed the data source for restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parsed the response and used the response to generate the site UI.
- Cached the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
- Followed the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.

**Stage Three** 
TBA
